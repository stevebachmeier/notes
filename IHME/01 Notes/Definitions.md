- Incidence: # of new cases in a population over a specified period of time. There is both incidence rate and incidence proportion
- Incidence rate (aka person-time rate): # of new cases in a population over the total time that population was at risk
    - Describes how quickly disease occurs in a population
    - incorporates time directly into the denominator
    - (# of new cases during specified period) / (total time observed)
- Prevalence: proportion of persons in a population who have a particular attribute at a specific time or over a specified period of time
    - Differs from incidence b/c it includes all cases (new and preexisting) whereas incidence is limited only to new cases
- Excess mortality rate
- ACMR (all cause mortality rate): best estimate of a simulant's mortality rate in the absense of information about diseases that a simulant is exposed to, ie it's just the "background" mortality rate
- Mortality rate: the likelihood of an individual dying
    MR_j=ACMR âˆ’SUM_c (CSMR_c )+SUM_c (EMR_c (s_j ,_c)
    - If we have info about a cause 'c', then we can adjust/refine a simulants mortality rate by 
        1. Starting with the ACMR
        2. Deleting the population-level CSMR for each cause 'c'
        3. Adding back in EMR as a function of wehter the individual has cause 'c' or not
