# 2022-07-22 - How did we get to where we're at?
- Started at the beginning of Covid
- RT is working with several different people - Catherine Johnson was originally the lead. But she also works on GBD and so just doesn't have the time
    - This led to a challenge to get info
    - They did a great job getting cause model and risk docuemtionation, but getting the intervention documentation has been a challenge
    - It's difficult to get a gbd researcher to understand the simulation side of things
- The RT initial model request is hugely complicated.
    - We are settling on a minimal viable model
	


Initial notes
- Paulina Lindstedt
    - In Seattle
- Syl - She's hired today to IHME as a researcher
- Funded by projects CSU (client services unit) brings.
- We help come up w/ evidence to make more informed choices.
