- Shoot to fininsh polypill by eow
- Heart failure: Abie wants to talk to greg again before Syl updates docs but they don't have another meeting w/ Greg
    - Abie suggests emailing Greg the doc change
- What else is there besides HF?
    - FPG. Exposure docs are done but not yet effect
        - Unsure how fpg will be inplemented, but if it's treated like a simple risk factor (as opposed to a paf-of-one) then it should be similar to bmi
    - BMI. Documented but there are some unanswered questions. High possibility that more mediation gets added later.
        - But regardless of what we mediate, we want the risk factors and risk effects - so maybe we can do that much?
        - IT's pretty clear now that bmi will be inlcuded and it will effeect some causes. If we can just use gbd data, it should be pretty simple to pull it and have it ready.
- Regarding fixing medication
    1. Fix initialization equations
    2. Add ASCVD gate to on-medicated side of treatment ramp
