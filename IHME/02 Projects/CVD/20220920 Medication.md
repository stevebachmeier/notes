- Adherence: assign the values from the table per simulant and that stays constant throughout
- Medication tables: those are in a csv and you only move up (/share/scratch/projects/cvd_gbd/cvd_re/simulation_science/drug_efficacy_sbp_new.csv)
    - File currently does not have permissions for me to access - Syl will update the file and then send it to me to add as repo data_packages
    - "monotherapy" - get one drug
    - Non-monotherapy - get more than one drug
- Need to track medication prescribed as well as actually adhered to
    - Add an adherence score column
    - NOTE: state C - do not apply adherence value here b/c they aren't yet prescribed anything
    - Consider making adherence only as they are prescribed medication
