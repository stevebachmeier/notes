- Do we re-draw all simulants every time? 
- It looks like it only affects primary non-adherent. So it doesn't affect secondar non-adherent at all?
- What about initialization?

So at id E (for sbp), 50% and 100% scenarios
- 50% is randomly assigned.
- How exacty do we change the already-initialized adherence levels?
    - Ie, I assume (a) adherent remains adherent, (b) secondary non-adherent remains, and (c) some portion of primary-non-adherent turns to adherent?
    - This means over time everyone will become secondary non-adherent or adherent

Intervention component
- VPH has a LinearScaleup component to subclass
- Potential simplest way to implement.
    - Change adherence column to a propensity column for adherence and an adherence pipeline
        - Propensity column never changes
        - Adherence pipeline which calculates actual categorical adherence. 
    - Do the choice function in the adherence pipeline using the propensity column

# Doc review:
- [x] No linear scale-up? Seems weird. Ask Syl.
    - *Usually* we want to get to the ideal situation by scale-up. (like linearly scale 0-50% or 0-100%). Suspicious b/c it's not the usual approach
    - But maybe they just want to see what would happen with the best case
    - If it's just a switch, then manage it within Treatment.
    - Syl's responses:
        - :star: **The plan was to have this linearly scale up over 1 year.**
- [x] Assumptions to confirm:
    - Linearly scaleup 0-50% over some timeframe
    - Outreach only affects people who are currently primary non-adherent and then turns them into fully adherent. 
    - Those who do change become fully adherent (and not secondary non-adherent)
- What do you want to happen to a given individual simulant when they're enrolled in outreach?
    - Are they going to become adherent?
    - Or is the population of people in outreach becomes more adherent? Ie some who are primary non-adherent -> secondary, and secondary -> adherent
    - Syl's response:
        - Regarding not touching secondary non-adherence, the paper specifically targeted primary non-adherence and tracked whether they became adherent.
        - Further, secondary would really never be called b/c the program is looking for people who never fulfilled prescriptions (ie secondary)
        - [ ] She will bring it up w/ abie
        - [ ] She will rpovide a percent value of those who are primary non-adherent and should switch to adherent
- [ ] Is there a separate outreach for each separate medication?
- [ ] Once on outreach, can you cease to be on outreach?
- [ ] Can we do more than one outreach at a time?
    - The docs do not make it clear if a simulant canj have outreach + polypill simultaneously. And if so, how to deal with it.

# DISCUSSION WITH RAJAN: IMPLEMENTATION
1. Implement outreach.
    1. Once a person gets to the enrollment node E, then X% of people are enrolled in outreach.
        1. Get new draws for everyone in this node to determine whether they are enrolled
    1. Then change their adherence value
2. Implement scale-up.
    1. Scale the percent quantity from 0-50% over the case of 1 year.
    2. The Treatment componenet will define an OutreachCoverage pipeline
        1. The source will just be a function that returns 0.
        2. Then add a value modifier that linearly incrases
    3. Override _register_intervention_modifiers.
        1. We don't want to modify exposure_parameters.
3. Need a column of whether or not a person is enrolled in the outreach program
    1. In order to answer the question, call the outreach coverage pipeline
    2. In Treatment component, do random draw against the probabilities of being enrolled.
    3. If enrolled in outreach, update the "enrolled in outreach" column

Extra notes:
- We need adherence to be a column and not a pipeline.
    - We need to call the pipeline when the doctor appointment happens and use that to set the column value at the time of the dr appointment.
    - Initialize using the pipeline I'm going to create

Oof, lots of discussion and I'm confused. Plan of attack.

Setups:
1. Risks.py: 'adherence' pipeline.
    1. Use the standard (polytomous) Risk class
2. Treatment: 'outreach_coverage' pipeline and 'outreach_coverage_propensity' column
    1. The column stays static and then we compare to the 'outreach_coverage' values
    2. The 'outreach_coverage' pipeline should return an indexed series of (the same) probability of coverage (ie 0-0.5 or 0-1)
    3. Utilize the LinearScaleup class
        1. Source: 0
        2. Value_modifer: that linearly increases
3. Treatment: register target modifier for 'adherence' pipeline
    1. Do a random draw against the chance of switching from primary non-adherent to adherent and update
		

Initializations:
1. Treatment: 'adherence' column
    1. Call the 'adherence' pipeline and set the column as that.
2. Treatment: 'outreach' column that defines whether a simulant is on the outreach program or not.
    1. Initialize it as 0 (not on outreach)

Treatment on_time_step_cleanup:
1. As part of the treatment ramp, for everyone who lands on the outreach node:
    1. Call 'outreach_coverage' pipeline to get percentage values
    2. ??? Subset appropriately. Do people on outreach go off depending on the draw? Or is it xx% of people not currently on outreach that are put on it?
    3. Call 'adherence' pipeline on the subset of people put on program - this should update some from primary non-adherence -> adherent
    4. Update the 'adherence' column.
		
Need to update branches file, something like
Input_draw_count: xxx
Random_seed_count: xxx
Branches:
	- Scenario: "baseline"
	- Scenario: "outreach_50"
	Outreach:
		Date:
			Start: 2023-01-01
			End: 2023-12-31
		Value:
			Start: 0
			End: 0.5
	- Scenario: "outreach_100"
	Outreach:
		Date:
			Start: 2023-01-01
			End: 2023-12-31
		Value:
			Start: 0
			End: 1

# Tickets
1. Redesign adherence into a pipelines + columns (one for each med)
    1. Risk("sbp.adherence")
    2. Treatment, on initialiation call pipeline and make the columns that
    3. Build an artifact item that is just repeated values of the adherence thresholds and sbp.adherence.distribution == "ordered_polytomous"
2. Implement exposure to outreach program as a Risk component
    1. Risk("medication.outreach")
    2. It should always just be 0% chance for this ticket.
    3. Be sure to test with non-zero values
    4. Do not affect adherence yet
3. Create OutreachEffect comoenent (no subclass here - it's too different)
    1. This creates and maintains the 'outreach' column
    2. It also register value modifiers for the Adherence pipellines (sbp and ldc adherence)
        1. The logic would compare the current outreach pipeline to the outreach column and modifies only those simulants that are different (ie are newly put on the outreach program)
            1. I can either re-draw values to send them
            2. Or I can have a sort of chance-of-moving propensity column defined on initialation
    3. Update the outreach column with the new people put on it
    4. In Treamtnet: where adherence can be updated, call pipeline and overwrite values
4. Implement outreach scaleup
    1. OutreachScaleup(LinearScaleup).
    2. Modify the exposure distribution parameters for Outreach.
    3. Will need to define time start and endpoints and value endpoints. 
        1. This can be done in configuratioin for a single run
        2. Done in branches.yaml for scenarios
    4. Update the branches config to work through scenarios
        1. If I can't get branches to work then need the logic in the component to get the correct scenario values.
