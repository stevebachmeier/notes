RT docs: https://vivarium-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/concept_models/vivarium_census_synthdata/concept_model.html#household-surveys

	- **new random**: samples the entire population at a defined time interval

- Sampling eligibility: 
	- currently living in US
	- determined to participate (there is a significant amount of non-response bias in surveys compared to the annual census)
