- Syl brought up that some of the observers probably aren't that important b/c there is no case study that will look at them - she brought up household survey observer as an example! Uhh...
	- Abie confirmed that while Syl is correct, it's still needed eventually. Plus, it's simpler than the other observers so makes for a good entry point.
- Talking about addresses: Zeb brought up that they'd like addresses to be split by street name and number. Jim and Rajan confirmed that's being done.
	- I think it's b/c they will have a different noise function for the street name and the street number
- Plan for Zeb and Abie and how they can help engineering (via jira tasks)
	- Zeb will work on migration
		- Writing of code is blocked by Jim's task of replacing addresses w/ address IDs
		- That said, Zeb needs to propose a design prior to writing code just like we all do
	- Abie will clean up the census observer
