Questions:
- HRC next week (m, t, maybe early wed)
    - Do I have an id card? Try bringing that.
    - Check w/ Helen
    - Reserve desks - check w/ Matt	
- What is the current ooo calendar preference? Ie do you want outlook invites?
    - No, continue outlook invites. The long-term goal is to have one place to communicate - but we're not there yet.
- The docs give the risk effect equation on iincidence. I had assumed that whatever vph is doing as a black box was correct - is this necessarily true? How do we know when we need to do bespoke things?
    - The relative risks apply to the incidence rates of acute ischemic stroke. They should be applied using the formula They should be applied using the formula incidence(i) = incidence*(1-PAFr107)*RR^{max((LDL-C_i - TMREL),0)}.
- Would adding a new risk slightly change the results of the previous risk results?

- I will probably not do the "normal" onboarding
    - Just start on CVD team
- CVD has been sort of cursed
    - Kjell started it but then retired
    - Matt had it for a bit but when eng caught up to research, they weren't ready
    - It's in a partially-created state - there is a model that does things. We just need to add to it
- Expect that I'd have support on that
    - He's unsure if it will be a pair-programming situation or just help-as-I-need-it
