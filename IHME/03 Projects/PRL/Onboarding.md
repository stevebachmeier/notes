Beatrix's onboarding docs: https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_census_prl_synth_pop/blob/main/docs/Vivarium%20Synthpop%20Overview.docx
- Thoughts:
    - Seems like lots of str dtypes. Wonder if we'd get speed boost by dealing with numbers only land then generating strings when needed (like an observer conversion)
    - Did they fork vivarium or build it right in?
    - Lots of fake/temporary data - what strategy to keep track of what needs updating?
