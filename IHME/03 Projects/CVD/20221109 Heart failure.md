Syl met with Greg and has a proposal for heart failure.
- Three parts - he did not like the idea of making HF and IHD totally indpenedent where simulants cannot have both.
        - Why? That's not realistic. People can get multiple heart attachs and he didn't like the idea that if someone gets ihd they are blocked from getting a future heart attack. 
            - Rajan wondered if this matters at a population level.
    - HF from IHD
        - Mortality associated with post-MI IHD
        - Prevalence will be from the HF envelop and proportion of HF that is IHD
    - IF from HHD (hyper-tensive heart disease)
        - Separated for the observer
        - They'd have the same risk of dying, etc. it's really just for the paper
    - HF from other
        - Same as above
