Three passwords:
- IHME password
- UW password
- Laptop password

But there should only be two "different" passwords:
- IHME + laptop (assuming you synced via NoMaD)
- UW

NOTE: The update every 119 days is a requirement for the IHME password

MACs don't inherently work with active directory - the need a man-in-the-middle (NoMaD)
Careful w/ lastpass b/c sometimes it will think you're changing pw when you're not.

Steps to changing IHME + laptop password:
1. log into the vpn
2. navigate to onelogin.com
3. sign in with known good ihme password
4. profile -> change password
5. Log out of NoMaD if you're logged into it
6. Log into NoMaD with the new password to "sync" your laptop password to the IHME password

**NOTE**: We never need to update our UW password so stick that in Lastpass and forget about it
